This bundle purpose is to manage third party assets. As it is
supposed to not adding third party assets to your public bundles and
still your bundle may be relied on them alternatively you can only add
information of desired third party assets to the bundle and in final
product developer can install them. It is possible to define multiple agents
(downloader or installer) service and tag them with erfans_asset.agent
and add alias attribute to use them in installing process. In asset
config files you can define different agent for each asset.
By now only Bower agent has implemented in this bundle.

Original tendency to develop this bundle was to have Mapping (for example
to wire up installed assets to RequireJs or to twig by assets alias)
and Optimizing step additionally to Downloading, but for now I have skipped
them.

Installation
Step 1: Download the Bundle

Open a command console, enter your project directory and execute the
following command to download the latest stable version of this bundle:

$ composer require erfans/asset-bundle "~1.2@dev"
This command requires you to have Composer installed globally, as explained
in the installation chapter
of the Composer documentation.

Step 2: Enable the Bundle

Then, enable the bundle by adding it to the list of registered bundles
in the app/AppKernel.php file of your project:

<?php
// app/AppKernel.php

// ...
class AppKernel extends Kernel
{
    public function registerBundles()
    {
        $bundles = array(
            // ...

            new Erfans\AssetBundle\ErfansAssetBundle(),
        );

        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
Step 3: Configuration

Default configuration for "ErfansAssetBundle":

#app\config\config.yml
erfans_asset:
    enabled:              false

    # Consider all bundles to check their asset config.
    all_bundles:          false

    # Bundles to check their asset config file.
    bundles:

        # Default:
        - AppBundle

    # Available agents by this bundle.
    agents:

        # File agent to install assets by file url
        file:
            # Install directory
            directory: "web/vendor"

            # Create directory per asset
            create_directory: true

        # Bower agent to download defined assets.
        bower:

            # Directory path to cache assets before installing. You need to change it if you use Symfony2.
            cache_path:           '%kernel.root_dir%/../var/erfans_asset/bower_cache/%kernel.environment%'

            # Install directory of assets. default directory is 'web/bower_components'.
            directory:            web/bower_components

                # Bower will ignore these dependencies when resolving packages.
                ignored_dependencies:  []
It is long configuration to customize bower agent, however, usual necessary configuration is:

#app\config\config.yml
erfans_asset:
    all_bundles: true

    agents:
        file:
            directory: "web/target-folder"
            create_directory: true
        bower:
            directory: "web/target-folder"
            github_token: github_token_to_extend_limitation
Note that if you use Symfony2 you need to change cash directory in configuration.

Step 3: Add bundle asset config file

To define required third party asset for each bundle create asset.yml file
in Resources/config directory of bundle.

#AppBundle\Resources\config\asset.yml
assets:
    jquery: # alias of asset
        installer: bower # name of installer, you can also define your own installer
        id: jquery       # id of repository which passes to installer
        version: ~1.9    # version of repository

    jquery_easing:
        installer: file
        id: http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/jquery.easing.1.3.js
Step 4: Install assets

To download and copy defined assets to target folder run command erfans:asset:install
by Symfony console.

This bundle uses bowerphp. Since this library does not support downloading files by url I added a file installer which download asset files and put them in final directory.

Step 5: Add assets to frontend

Now you can add installed assets to your twig or other asset loaders such
as RequireJs.
